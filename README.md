## How to Add Logo Images

### Option 1: Download from Official Websites
Visit each insurance company's media/press page and download their official logo:
- Progressive: https://www.progressive.com/newsroom/
- Nationwide: https://www.nationwide.com/about-us/newsroom/
- Travelers: https://www.travelers.com/about-us/press-kit
- etc.

### Option 2: Use Logo Database Services
- **Brands of the World**: https://www.brandsoftheworld.com/
- **Seek Logo**: https://seeklogo.com/
- **World Vector Logo**: https://worldvectorlogo.com/
- **Logo Wine**: https://www.logo.wine/

### Logo Specifications
- **Format:** PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG
- **Size:** 400-800px wide recommended
- **Aspect Ratio:** Maintain original logo proportions
- **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display

### CSS Styling Applied
The website automatically applies these effects to all logos:
- **Grayscale filter** (70% opacity) by default
- **Full color on hover** with smooth transition
- **Max height:** 60px to maintain consistent sizing
- **Object-fit:** contain (preserves aspect ratio)

### Temporary Solution
If logos are not available, the partner cards will display with company names as text fallbacks. The cards are styled professionally and will automatically display logo images once they are added to the `images/` folder.

## File Naming Convention
Use lowercase with hyphens:
- ✅ `progressive-logo.png`
- ✅ `blue-cross-blue-shield-logo.png`
- ❌ `Progressive Logo.PNG`
- ❌ `BCBS.jpg`
